			<p>Elementalist are swordmages that specialize in magic originating from the elemental planes. By binding the primal power of the planes to themselves, these swordmages become mortal embodiments of the elements. They might show minor physical manifestations of this power such as earthen skin, an ozone smell, or damp hair.</p>

      <p>When you reach 15th level, when you activate your aegis, planar energy converges on you. You gain one of the following features. You can choose to gain the feature of the same type as your Elemental Attunement or a different one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Air:</b> While your Aegis is active, and when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</li>
        <li><b>Earth:</b> When you activate your Aegis, you gain the toughness of mountains. You gain temporary hit points equal to your Swordmage level plus your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1).</li>
        <li><b>Fire:</b> While your Aegis is active, and when you make a weapon attack from Blade Magic, the attack deals additional fire damage equal to 1d8 per level of the spell cast.</li>
        <li><b>Water:</b> While your Aegis is active, when you hit a creature of a large or smaller size with a melee weapon attack or damage them with a spell from the Water Attunement Aegis Spells, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your swordmage spell save DC or be knocked prone.</li>

    <description>
      <p>At 20th level, you can temporarily transform into an avatar of your chosen element. As a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you can also activate your Elemental Avatar, which lasts for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest. You gain one of the following Elemental Avatars. You can choose to gain the feature of the same type as your Elemental Attunement or a different one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Air Avatar:</b> You become a living storm. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet. As a bonus action, you can shoot a bolt of lightning at a creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 lightning damage and you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to them.</li>
        <li><b>Earth Avatar:</b> Your skin hardens to stone. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, they must succeed a Strength saving throw against your swordmage spell save DC or become restrained until the end of your next turn as they are encased in stone.</li>
        <li><b>Fire Avatar:</b> Your form becomes writhing flames. You gain immunity to fire damage. You also create an aura of flames around you in a 15-foot radius. Any creature of your choice that enters the aura for the first time or starts their turn in your aura takes 4d8 fire damage.</li>
        <li><b>Water Avatar:</b> You assume a watery form that is difficult to pin down. You are under the effects of the freedom of movement spell. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 4d8 and teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.</li>
