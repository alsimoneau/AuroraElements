      <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b>Aegis of Gravity.</b> As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to infuse yourself with the strength of the stars. For the duration of this Aegis, you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see moves, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature's speed drops to 0 until the start of their next turn. This stops any movement they may have been taking. Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.</p>
