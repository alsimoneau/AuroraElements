      <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b>Aegis of Summoning.</b> As a bonus action, you create a floating magical weapon called an Aegis Blade within 30 feet of you. When you activate this aegis, you can make a melee attack against a creature within range of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your ability modifier. The ability modifier you use for your Aegis Blade is the same modifier you use for your Arcane Weapon.</p>
      <p class="indent">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move your Aegis Blade up to 30 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within range of it.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 15th level of this class, the damage from your Aegis Blade increases to 2d8.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your Aegis Blade lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, you can conjure weapons out of magical energy using your knowledge of craftsmanship. You gain proficiency in smith's tools.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can also perform a ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, to create any weapon. The weapon you create cannot be magical.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can have a number of created weapons up to your proficiency bonus. If you are at your maximum limit of created weapons, and you attempt to create a new weapon, then you must destroy one of your previously created weapons.</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your summoned blade to block attacks. When you see a creature hit with a melee attack and your Aegis Blade is within melee range of the creature, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the attacked target's AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, you can quickly summon a weapon to impale a foe. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your swordmage spell save DC. The target takes 4d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
      <p class="indent">Also on a failure, if the target is on solid ground or next to a solid mass (such as a wall or tree), they are restrained. The creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your swordmage spell save DC. If it succeeds, the weapon is removed and vanishes, and the creature is no longer restrained.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

As a bonus action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to either your Aegis Blade or a weapon created from your Conjured Steel or Pinning Spear features. If you are teleporting to your Aegis Blade, you can do so as part of the same bonus action to command your Aegis Blade. The teleportation fails if the summoned weapon is more than 30 feet from you.</p>
