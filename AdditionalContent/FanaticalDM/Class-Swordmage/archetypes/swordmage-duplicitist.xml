      <p>When you reach 7th level, your slippery magic aids your subterfuge. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the proficiency you gained from your Cunning Trickery feature.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can also use mind altering magic to make your spells difficult to resist. When a creature makes a saving throw against one of your spells, you can impose disadvantage on the saving throw as a reaction. Once you use this reaction, you can't use it again until after a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>Starting at 15th level, you can quickly escape from danger while leaving behind a mirror image of yourself. When you turn invisible from a spell or your Aegis, you can also teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You also leave behind an illusionary image of you that shares your AC and saving throws. A creature that uses an action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your swordmage spell save DC.</p>
      <p class="indent">The image lasts until your invisibility ends or if the image is damaged.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

The duplicate cannot use Double Trouble on itself.</p>
      <p class="indent">The shadowy duplicate fades away after 1 minute or once it falls to 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest.</p>
