      <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b>Aegis of the Guardian.</b> As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis and then ward an ally within 30 feet of you that you can see. Depending on your Guardian Role, you gain one of the following reactions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defender:</b> When you see your warded ally hit by an attack and they are within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to create a magical shield surrounding them, and you halve the attack's damage (rounded down) against them.</li>
				<li><b>Punisher:</b> When you see a creature within 30 feet of you attack your warded ally, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to the attacker and make one weapon attack against the creature.</li>
			</ul>
      <p class="indent">On later turns, you can use a bonus action to change your warded target to another ally within 30 feet of you that you can see. Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.</p>

      <p>When you reach 11th level, you learn a ritual to magically bind yourself to another person to better protect them. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The person must be within your reach throughout the ritual, and must be willing. After the ritual is concluded, you can sense the location of the chosen person as long as they are on the same plane of existence as you. You can sense when the person is damaged, affected by a hostile magical effect, or killed.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to your bound person as long as they are on the same plane of existence as you. Teleporting in this way consumes the magic of the bond, ending the connection between the two of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you attempt to bond with another person, you must break your current bond.</p>
