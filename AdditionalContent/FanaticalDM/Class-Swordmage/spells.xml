				<p>You interrupt a creature's attack by warping space with your blade, causing your foe to appear a short distance away and unleash its attack elsewhere. The creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from their original location. That space must be on the ground or on a floor. The creature then makes their attack against another creature of your choosing within range. If there is no creature within range, the attack is expended.</p>
