      <p>When you reach 15th level, you can lock a creature in a moment of time. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. If the creature is willing, then they are locked in time for 1 minute. While locked in time, the target's speed is reduced to 0, and the target can't take any actions, be affected by any other effect, and is immune to all damage. The time lock lasts for 1 minute or until you end the effect on your turn (no action required).</p>
      <p class="indent">An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your swordmage spell save DC. On a success, the creature isn't affected by this feature. At the end of each turn of an unwilling, affected target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the time lock ends on the target.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, as a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you can create a beacon in time, intending to return to it if things go wrong. Keep careful track of everything that happens until the beacon disappears at the start of your next turn. Before the beacon ends, you can use your reaction to rewind time for only yourself. You return to the space you were when you created the Time Beacon and undo any harmful effects that happened to you including any damage you took. You also regain any expended resources spent during that time. If the space where you created the beacon is occupied, you return to the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
